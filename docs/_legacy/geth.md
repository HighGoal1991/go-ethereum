title: Geth
---
`geth` is the the command line interface for running a full ethereum node implemented in Go. 
It is the main deliverable of the [Frontier Release](https://ethereum.gitbooks.io/frontier-guide/content/frontier.html)

## Capabilities

By installing and running `geth`, you can take part in the ethereum frontier live network and
* mine real ether 
* transfer funds between addresses
* create contracts and send transactions
* explore block history
* and much much more

## Install 

Supported Platforms are Linux, Mac Os and Windows.

We support two types of installation: binary or scripted install for users. 
See [Install instructions](../install-and-build/Building-Ethereum) for binary and scripted installs.

Developers and community enthusiast are advised to read the [Developers' Guide](../install-and-build/Developers-Guide), which contains detailed instructions for manual build from source (on any platform) as well as detailed tips on testing, monitoring, contributing, debugging and submitting pull requests on github.

## Interfaces

* Javascript Console: `geth` can be launched with an interactive console, that provides a javascript runtime environment exposing a javascript API to interact with your node. [Javascript Console API](../interface/JavaScript-Console) includes the `web3` javascript √êapp API as well as an additional admin API. 
* JSON-RPC server: `geth` can be launched with a json-rpc server that exposes the [JSON-RPC API](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/JSON-RPC)
* [Command line options](../interface/Command-Line-Options) documents command line parameters as well as subcommands.

## Basic Use Case Documentation

* [Managing accounts](../how-to/Managing-your-accounts)
* [Mining](../how-to/Mining)

**Note** buying and selling ether through exchanges is not discussed here.
